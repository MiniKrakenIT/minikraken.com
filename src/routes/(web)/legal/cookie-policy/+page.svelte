		<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
		<p><strong>Last Updated: February 23, 2025</strong></p>
		<p>This Cookie Policy explains how <span class="font-semibold">[Your Website Name]</span> ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on <a href="#" class="underline">[yourwebsite.com]</a> (the "Site"). We’re committed to protecting your privacy under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if you’re in the EU/EEA.</p>

		<h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
		<p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device to help the Site work, improve your experience, or analyze usage.</p>

		<h2>Cookies We Use</h2>
		<p>We use the following categories of cookies, including some set by third-party services we rely on (e.g., Cloudflare for security/performance, Google Analytics for usage tracking):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Essential Cookies</strong>: Required to make the Site function (e.g., for navigation or security features). These may be session-based (temporary) or persistent (stored longer-term).</li>
			<li><strong>Analytics Cookies</strong>: Help us understand how visitors use the Site (e.g., which pages are popular) to improve it. These may persist for months or years.</li>
			<li><strong>Marketing Cookies</strong>: Used to deliver relevant ads or content, often based on your activity on our Site or others. Durations vary by provider.</li>
			<li><strong>Functional Cookies</strong>: Enhance your experience (e.g., remembering preferences or settings). These can last from days to years.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Specific cookie names and durations depend on our tools and third-party services, and they may change as we update the Site. These third parties may process data, often in the U.S., under their own policies. We’re not responsible for their data practices—visit their websites for details (e.g., <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" class="underline">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" class="underline">Google Privacy Policy</a>). Data transfers outside the EU/EEA rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or your consent.</p>

		<h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Essential Cookies</strong>: Necessary for basic Site operation. We use these based on our legitimate interest in providing the service.</li>
			<li><strong>Non-Essential Cookies</strong>: Analytics, marketing, and functional cookies require your prior consent. We only set these if you agree via our cookie banner.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Your Choices and Consent</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Cookie Banner</strong>: On your first visit, you can accept, reject, or customize non-essential cookies. Essential cookies don’t need consent.</li>
			<li><strong>Browser Settings</strong>: Block or delete cookies anytime—see your browser’s help section. Disabling essential cookies may affect Site functionality.</li>
			<li><strong>Withdraw Consent</strong>: Adjust preferences in our cookie banner or contact us.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Your GDPR Rights</h2>
		<p>If you’re in the EU/EEA, you have rights over your data, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Access, correct, or delete your data.</li>
			<li>Restrict or object to processing.</li>
			<li>Data portability.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To exercise these, email <a href="mailto:[your@email.com]" class="underline">[your@email.com]</a>.</p>

		<h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
		<p>We may update this policy—check the “Last Updated” date for changes.</p>
